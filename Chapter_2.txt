11: What values are stored in x and y after execution of the following program segment?

  int x = 30;
  int y = 40;
  if (x >= 0){
    y = x * 3;
    if(y < 50){
      x /= 10;
    }
    else{
      y = x * 2;
    }
  }
  else{
    y = -x;
  }
  
  
12: Which of the following will evaluate to true only if boolean expressions A,B and C are all false?

a) !A && !(B && !C)
b) !A || !B || !C
c) !(A || !B || !C)
d) !(A && B && C)
e) !A || !(B || !C)


13: Assume that a and b are integers. The boolean expression
    !(a <= b) && (a * b > 0)
    will always evaluate to true given that:
    
a) a = b
b) a > b
c) a < b
d) a > b and b > 0
e) a > b and b < 0
